## tl;dr

A lot of times we develop bash scripts. But how can we make sure, that the
user/customer has bash, or the right version. Letâ€™s make bash easy to ship.

To install bash should be just a download/unzip, instead of apt-get/yum/brew.
There is already a [bash-static](https://github.com/robxu9/bash-static),
but i wanted to reduce the download size.
